You can access the Web UI at: `http://your-domain:9090`

## Docker-compose

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

    version: "3.7"

    services:
      db:
        image: postgres:13
        ports:
          - "172.17.0.1:5432:5432"
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
          - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
          - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
        restart: unless-stopped
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U listmonk"]
          interval: 10s
          timeout: 5s
          retries: 6
        container_name: listmonk_db
        volumes:
          - ./listmonk-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

      app:
        restart: unless-stopped
        image: elestio4test/listmonk:${SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG}
        command: [sh, -c, "yes | ./listmonk --install --config config.toml && ./listmonk --config config.toml"]
        ports:
          - "172.17.0.1:9090:9000"
        environment:
          - TZ=Etc/UTC
        container_name: listmonk_app
        depends_on:
          - db
        volumes:
          - ./config.toml:/listmonk/config.toml

### Environment variables

|       Variable       |     Value (example)     |
| :------------------: | :---------------------: |
|       ADMIN_EMAIL    |  admin email            |
|     ADMIN_PASSWORD   |  admin password         |
|   SOFTWARE_VERSION   |  latest                 |

# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio Listmonk Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
